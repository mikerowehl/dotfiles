I use bash on a few different operating systems, and lots of different versions. Keeping a single
source in full that checks to see what capabilities are installed on which systems and doing all
the conditional includes is just a nightmare. So instead I put in a few snippets I often use, like
getting a prompt that shows details of previous command status. And I just append those, which 
necessary checks in those snippets, instead of giving a full replacement bash config.
